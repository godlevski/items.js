Items.js
========

Items.js is yet small collection of prototypes for working with itemized data, e.g. inventory lists, that is to be processed in javascript enviropment and futher saved to file or displayed on the page.

It might grow into larger excel like javascript aplication in the future or stay as is.

Prototype is library independant. Basic types e.i. Items, Items.group and Items.index inherit from Items.collection, which in its turn does from Array, so all of standard Array methods can be used on instances of those types.

Please review a demo page for basic use example.
